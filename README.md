All editions have all the modules and features. The only difference is where the software is running.

**Desktop Edition** is installed on your computer whether it's Windows, Mac or Linux. It's free forever to use, however due to its nature it doesn't support multi-user access.

**Cloud Edition** is hosted in the cloud. There is nothing to install and users can access the software from any computer or mobile device through a web browser. Cloud Edition also supports multi-user access.
