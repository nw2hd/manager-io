# Guides

Manager.io is a versatile accounting software that caters to the unique needs of diverse businesses.

Customize the software by activating only the modules you need, adding custom fields to capture business-specific data, and generating reports tailored to your operations.

For example, a retail store may activate the Inventory Items tab, while a consulting firm might prioritize Billable Time.

# Available Editions

Manager.io is available in three editions: Desktop Edition, Cloud Edition and Server Edition.

All editions have all the modules and features. The only difference is where the software is running.

**Desktop Edition** is installed on your computer whether it's Windows, Mac or Linux. It's free forever to use, however due to its nature it doesn't support multi-user access.

**Cloud Edition** is hosted in the cloud. There is nothing to install and users can access the software from any computer or mobile device through a web browser. Cloud Edition also supports multi-user access.
